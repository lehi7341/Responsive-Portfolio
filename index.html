                <p>
                I am originally from Fillmore, California which is a small town about 45 minutes north west of Los Angeles. 

                Lived there all my life until I moved here to Utah back in 2006. 

                I come from a family of 10 consisting of 6 boys and 2 girls. 

                I got married just under 2 years ago to my beautiful wife Sharlene and now live in Pleasant Grove.

                I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, snowboarding, and water activities.

                The gym is my second home as I enjoy lifting weights and pushing myself to reach new fitness levels. 

                Working out helps me de-stress from everyday life.
